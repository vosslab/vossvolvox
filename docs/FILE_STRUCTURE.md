## Generated artifacts
- [bin/](bin/): executable outputs from [src/Makefile](src/Makefile).
- [src/](src/): object files like `*.o` created during builds.
- [tests/pdb_to_xyzr_results/](tests/pdb_to_xyzr_results/): cached downloads,
  XYZR outputs, and MD5s from converter tests.
- [tests/volume_results/](tests/volume_results/): volume outputs and test
  artifacts from [tests/test_suite.py](tests/test_suite.py).
- [tests/](tests/): downloaded `*.pdb`, `*.pdb.gz`, and `*.xyzr` files from
  shell tests.
- [test/volume_results/](test/volume_results/): legacy cached outputs.

## Where to add new work
- New C++ tools: add entry points in [src/](src/) and targets in
  [src/Makefile](src/Makefile).
- Shared C++ helpers: extend [src/lib/](src/lib/).
- Converters and filters: use [src/](src/) for native code or [xyzr/](xyzr/)
  for scripting.
- Python utilities: place scripts in [python/](python/).
- Tests: add harnesses and fixtures in [tests/](tests/).
- Docs: add SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE markdown files in [docs/](docs/).

# AUTHORS

## Neil R. Voss

Neil R. Voss is an Associate Professor of Biology at [Roosevelt University](https://www.roosevelt.edu) in Chicago and the sole or primary author of this repository. He has been a faculty member at Roosevelt University since 2010, teaching across biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, cellular biology, and biostatistics.

Dr. Voss holds a Ph.D. in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu), where his graduate research focused on ribosome structure, RNA geometry, and macromolecular crystallography under the supervision of Peter B. Moore and Thomas A. Steitz. He earned undergraduate degrees in Physics and Mathematics from [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu), graduating with distinction and honors.

### Research and Technical Background

Dr. Voss's research background spans structural biology, cryo electron microscopy, computational geometry, and scientific software development. His work has included the development of computational tools for analyzing protein geometry, ribosomal exit tunnels, molecular volumes, and electron microscopy image processing workflows.

He has contributed to and maintained a number of widely used tools in the cryoEM ecosystem, including work associated with Appion, Leginon, TiltPicker, DoG Picker, ACE2, FindEM, and related pipelines. His published research includes peer reviewed work in journals such as *Journal of Structural Biology*, *Journal of Molecular Biology*, *Nucleic Acids Research*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, and *Nano Letters*.

While no longer actively developing cryoEM software, this prior work continues to inform his approach to computational rigor, reproducibility, and open scientific tooling.

### Open Educational Resources

Dr. Voss is currently focused on the development of grant funded Open Educational Resources for undergraduate and graduate science education. His OER work emphasizes computationally generated, sharing resistant problem sets designed to support fair assessment in online and hybrid learning environments.

He is the primary author and maintainer of the [Biology Problems](https://biologyproblems.org) project, which provides free and open problem sets for biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and biostatistics. This work is supported by multiple state and federal grants, including funding from the Illinois State Library and the National Science Foundation.

His educational philosophy prioritizes clarity, conceptual understanding, and accessibility, particularly for students encountering quantitative and computational concepts in biology for the first time.

### Software Development

Dr. Voss has extensive experience in scientific programming, with a primary focus on Python. His software work emphasizes transparency, reproducibility, and long term maintainability. He favors open source licensing models that balance freedom of use with appropriate attribution and academic integrity.

He maintains an active presence on [GitHub](https://github.com/vosslab) where he publishes educational tooling, scientific utilities, and supporting infrastructure for OER delivery.

### Additional Interests

Outside of academia and software development, Dr. Voss is a Lego artist and an active member of the [Northern Illinois Lego Train Club](https://www.niltc.org). This work reflects a long standing interest in spatial reasoning, mechanical systems, and visual problem solving.
